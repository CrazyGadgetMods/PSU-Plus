The PSU-Plus is the spiritual successor to Noah's RVL-PSU, designed for ease of assembly and versatility across many micro-type builds.

Like it's predecessor, the PSU-Plus has 1V, 1.15V, 3.3V and 5V regulators. Where the PSU-Plus differs is the addition of a 1.8V regulator for builds that remove the LDO from the Wii (such as Wesk's GC Micro and the GC Nano).

I designed this board when the TLV62130RGTR regulators were out of stock as a drop-in replacement for the RVL-PSU. It has the exact same board outline dimensions, as well as the same screw hole layout / dimensions.

I have added an additional VIN pad for builds that use VIN elsewhere in the project (such as feeding 12V to the audio amplifier / sensor bar in the Noldendo Miicro). I have also added jumper pads to enable / disable the 1v8 and 5v regulars if your build does not require either of them.

**VIN Min: `rgb(0, 0, 255)`5V**
**VIN Max: `rgb(255, 0, 0)`18V**
**Max current output (per regulator): `rgb(255, 255, 0)`3A**
